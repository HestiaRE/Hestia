# HestiaRE shell lint gate (#477). Check-only, never rewrites a file.
#
# Two tiers, because the tree carries ~240 inherited HestiaCP warnings (SC2046/SC2166/SC2164) that
# are a separate cleanup job. A gate that demanded them today would be red forever and get ignored:
#
#   TIER 1  whole tree, severity=error   - must always pass (0 findings as of this commit)
#   TIER 2  changed files, >=warning     - new/edited code must not add warnings
#
# Both tiers read .shellcheckrc, which disables only the verified house idioms. Formatting is
# checked with shfmt against .editorconfig (tabs, spaced redirections, leading `&&`, indented case)
# - the same settings HestiaCP's prettier-plugin-sh uses, so the tree already conforms.
#
# Usage:  .gitea/tools/lint-shell.sh           # tier 1 + tier 2 vs origin/dev (what CI runs)
#         .gitea/tools/lint-shell.sh --all     # tier 2 over the whole tree as well
#         .gitea/tools/lint-shell.sh --base X  # diff against X instead of origin/dev

# pulling one in would paint tier 1 red on a file no tool here can judge. That is the assumption
# this derivation carries - a zsh script would be invisible to both the list and this check, and it

# Regenerate one key registry from the list compiled into this file.
#
# Two holes it closes. conf/defaults/*.conf is written at install time, so on a box installed before
# a key was added the registry is stale and a repair reading it skips exactly the key it exists to
# add. And when the file is missing entirely, the fallback below used to call write_kv_config_file
# with whatever $known_keys happened to hold - empty at that point - which wrote an EMPTY registry
# and made it permanent, silently reducing every later repair to a no-op.
#
# Each format function ends with `unset system`, so callers set $system AFTER this, never before.
#
# Never reports failure. The registry dir is root-owned and every caller runs as root, so a failed
# write means something is wrong elsewhere - and the useful reaction is to carry on with the keys
# already on disk, not to abort a domain add. A non-zero return here would do exactly that in any
# caller running under `set -e`.

	# The value is carried across VERBATIM. The previous loop rebuilt each line from a parsed value
	# and cut everything after the first '#' to strip an inline comment, which silently truncated any
	# value that legitimately contains one: SERVER_SMTP_PASSWD, PHPMYADMIN_KEY, every generated
	# secret. cmp then found a difference by construction and copied the truncated file over the
	# real one. Reproduced: 'p4ss#w0rd!x' came out as 'p4ss'. It also fed the value through a sed
	# replacement, where a '|' or '&' in a password rewrites the expression. An inline comment can
	# only be recognised after the closing quote, never at the first '#', so this no longer tries.
	#
	# TRUNCATE, and remove unconditionally below: with `touch` plus `>>`, a .new file left behind by a
	# run that found nothing to fix was appended to on the next one - so a key deleted in the meantime
	# came back from the stale copy. Reproduced: delete a key, run twice, the key returns.

# File manager private listener - apache variant (#419). Rendered to
# /etc/apache2/conf.d/fm-%user%.conf by h-add-user-filemanager only in the
# apache-only case (no nginx front). Needs the port's Listen line, which fm_front_write keeps in
# fm--listen.conf, and mod_proxy_fcgi (already used by web pools).
# Loopback-only; only Panel-Caddy reaches it, proven by the shared secret header.

# File manager - per-customer FPM pool behind a panel-authenticated proxy (#419).
# Rendered (port + secret substituted) to /etc/caddy/apps/filemanager.conf by
# h-add-sys-filemanager, 0640 root:caddy because it carries the shared secret.
# Removed by h-delete-sys-filemanager → /fm/ becomes a 404 when not installed.
#
# Two OVERWRITTEN headers are the entire Caddy-side trust model (§7.2 invariant).
# Neither may ever come from the client:
#   Host              fm-<user>.local  - taken from the forward_auth response
#                     (X-Hestia-User), NEVER the client; selects the customer's
#                     vhost on the private listener.
#   X-Hestia-FM-Auth  <secret>         - proves the request came from Caddy; the
#                     private listener 403s without it. A client value is replaced.
# The customer identity is decided ONLY by fm-auth.php (valid panel session + that
# user's FILE_MANAGER='yes'). The pool then runs as that customer, so the kernel
# UID - not this proxy - is the actual file-access boundary.
#
# /fm is deliberately NOT stripped: TFM builds its self-URLs from PHP_SELF, so
# keeping the prefix keeps its links/asset refs correct without patching the app.
